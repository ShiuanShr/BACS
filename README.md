# BACS

This repo is for Business Analytics Using Computational Statistics (BACS) at National Tsinghua University.

For this repo, it was graded as top 10 (A+) in 2022 Spring. If you are interested, some course notes and cheat sheets are provided here: https://medium.com/@shiuanshr

I genuinely hope that this repository will be able to assist first-year students who are struggling with computational statistics. But keep in mind that it's more important to have learned something than to have "done" your homework. Instead of relying on the requirements of the questions, it is advisable to use intuition. The reason is that there won't be any "hints" and the data will be a mess when we conduct independent study or carry out projects in the industry.

It would be great that you begin developing your data intuition right away.
