# BACS

This repo is for Business Analytics Using Computational Statistics (BACS) at National Tsinghua University.

For this repo, it was graded as top 10 (A+) in 2022 Spring. If you are interested, some course notes and cheat sheets are provided here: https://medium.com/@shiuanshr

I sincerely hope that this repo can help freshmen who are having trouble dealing with computational statistics. But remember, what really matters is whether you learned something, not whether you "finished" the homework. It's best done with intuition rather than relying on questions' requirements. The reason is that when we do independent research or implement projects in the industry, there will be no "hints" and the data will be messed up.
