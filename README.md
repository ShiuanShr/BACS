# BACS

This repo is for Business Analytics Using Computational Statistics (BACS) at National Tsinghua University.
I sincerely hope this repo can help the new students having a tough time dealing with computational statistics. But remember, what really matters is whether you learn something, instead of  "completing" the assignments.

For this repo, it was graded as top 10 (A+) in 2022 Spring. If you are interested, some course notes and cheat sheets are provided here: https://medium.com/@shiuanshr
