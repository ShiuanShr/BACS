# BACS

This repo is for the Business Analytics Using Computational Statistics (BACS) in National TsingHua Unicversity.

It's one of my favorite course. I have some course note/cheat sheet provided here: https://medium.com/@shiuanshr

I hoped this can help the new students who have a tough time dealing with computational statistics. But remember, what really matters is whether you learn something, instead of  "completing" the assignments.
